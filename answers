1. Components of a Database Management System (DBMS)
Database Engine: Handles data storage, retrieval, and update. It ensures efficient query processing and data management.
Database Schema: Defines the logical structure of the database, including tables, fields, and relationships.
Query Processor: Translates user queries (written in SQL or similar languages) into actions that the database engine can perform.
Transaction Management: Ensures data consistency by handling multiple transactions and maintaining atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties).
Security Management: Controls access to the database by defining user roles, permissions, and data encryption.
Reporting and Analytics Tools: Provide insights by generating reports and visualizing data.

2. What is a Relational Database?
A relational database stores data in a structured format, using tables with rows and columns. Relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys.
Examples include:
a)MySQL
b)PostgreSQL
c)Microsoft SQL Server

3. Classifications of SQL
SQL can be classified into three major types:
a)Data Definition Language (DDL): Commands to define or modify database structures (e.g., CREATE, ALTER, DROP).
b)Data Manipulation Language (DML): Commands to manage data within the tables (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT).
c)Data Control Language (DCL): Commands to control access to data (e.g., GRANT, REVOKE).

5. Difference Between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key
Feature	Primary Key	Foreign Key
Primary key	uniquely identifies records in a table while foreign key establishes a relationship with another table.
primary key must be unique for each record while foreign key Can have duplicate values if referencing the same primary key.

6. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)?
An ERD is a visual representation of entities (e.g., people, objects, concepts) and their relationships in a database.

7. Advantages of Relational Databases
Data Integrity: Enforces rules (e.g., primary/foreign keys) to maintain accurate and consistent data.
Flexibility: Data can be easily queried and updated using SQL.
Scalability: Supports large datasets and multiple concurrent users.
Data Security: Provides access controls and permissions to protect data.
Redundancy Minimization: Normalization reduces data duplication.

7. Four Types of Data Types Used in Tables
Integer: Stores whole numbers (e.g., INT, BIGINT).
Character/String: Stores text (e.g., CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT).
Date/Time: Stores temporal data (e.g., DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP).
Floating-Point/Decimal: Stores numbers with decimal points (e.g., FLOAT, DECIMAL).

8. Purpose of a Database Management System (DBMS)
The purpose of a DBMS include:
Data Organization: Stores data in a structured format.
Data Retrieval: Allows users to query and retrieve specific data efficiently.
Data Consistency and Integrity: Enforces rules to maintain accurate and consistent data.
Data Security: Protects data with access controls and encryption.
Concurrency Management: Supports multiple users accessing the database simultaneously.
